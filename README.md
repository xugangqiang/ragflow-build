# ragflow-build

Vendored third-party dependencies and their release pipelines.

Each dependency owns a self-contained directory at the repository root:

```
.
├── .github/workflows/           # release pipelines (GitHub requires this path)
│   └── onnxruntime-release.yml
└── onnxruntime/                 # everything for this dependency
    ├── ORT_VERSION              # pinned upstream tag, e.g. v1.29.0
    ├── build.sh                 # build entry point
    ├── scripts/

    └── onnxruntime/             # upstream git submodule (microsoft/onnxruntime)
```

Adding another dependency later means adding one more top-level directory plus
one more workflow file — nothing here is onnxruntime specific except the
directory itself.

## onnxruntime

Pinned to **v1.29.0** (see `onnxruntime/ORT_VERSION`).

### 1. Get the sources

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ragflow-build
cd ragflow-build
bash onnxruntime/scripts/init-submodules.sh
```

This registers the submodule, checks out exactly the tag in `ORT_VERSION` and
pulls the recursive build dependencies. Use `--full` for an unshallow clone.

### 2. Build

```bash
cd onnxruntime
./build.sh \
    --config Release \
    --cmake_extra_defines onnxruntime_BUILD_SHARED_LIB=OFF \
    --minimal_build \
    --disable_ml_ops \
    --disable_rtti \
    --disable_exceptions \
    --parallel
```

All of the flags above are already the defaults, so a plain `./build.sh` is
identical. `--include_ops_by_config onnxruntime/required_ops.config` is applied
by default as well.

`--disable_contrib_ops` is deliberately **not** used. After ORT graph
optimization the deepdoc models depend on the `com.microsoft` fusion kernels
`FusedConv` / `FusedMatMul` / `QuickGelu`, and that flag strips them, leaving
the models unloadable (`Could not find an implementation for FusedMatMul(1)`
and friends).

Anything you pass is forwarded to upstream
`tools/ci_build/build.py`; project managed options take precedence:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--target <name>` | `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, `osx-arm64`, `osx-x86_64`, `osx-universal`, `windows-x64`, `windows-arm64`. Default: detected from the host. Windows targets are implemented but not exercised in CI right now, see [Platform status](#platform-status). |
| `--build-dir <path>` | Build root. Default `onnxruntime/build/<target>`. |
| `--dist-dir <path>` | Where the archive lands. Default `onnxruntime/dist`. |
| `--jobs <n>`, `-j <n>` | Max parallel compile jobs. Default: one per core, capped at 4 when less than 8 GB of RAM is free. |
| `--update` | Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` first. |
| `--clean` | Wipe the build directory for this target first. |
| `--no-package` | Build only, skip the tarball/zip. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Full help. |

onnxruntime translation units are memory hungry (~1–1.5 GB each), so building
with one job per core gets OOM killed on a small machine. Use `--jobs 2` if 4 is
still too much.

Extra defaults applied on top:

- `--skip_tests` — upstream `build.py` runs ctest by default, which downloads
  hundreds of MB of ONNX test data. Pass `--test` to opt back in.
- `--cmake_generator Ninja` — unix only, and only when ninja is installed.
  Windows keeps the Visual Studio generator.
- `--compile_no_warning_as_error` — new compilers trip `-Werror` upstream.
- `--allow_running_as_root` — only when running as root.

Build trees are platform specific: `onnxruntime/build/<target>` for most
targets, and `onnxruntime/build/osx-universal/{arm64,x86_64,universal}` for the
universal build.

### 3. Artifacts

`onnxruntime/dist/onnxruntime-<version>-<target>.zip` plus a `.sha256` file.
Every platform ships a zip, so consumers need only one extraction tool:

```
onnxruntime-v1.29.0-linux-x86_64/
├── BUILD_INFO.txt        # version, target, commit, configuration
├── LICENSE
├── include/              # public headers, flattened like upstream packages
│   ├── onnxruntime_c_api.h
│   ├── onnxruntime_cxx_api.h
│   ├── cpu_provider_factory.h
│   └── ...
└── lib/
    └── libonnxruntime.a  # single fat static library
```

Windows produces `lib/onnxruntime.lib` instead of `lib/libonnxruntime.a`; the
archive is a zip there too.

A static build has no single self-contained `libonnxruntime.a`: the
`onnxruntime` CMake target is an `INTERFACE` library that pulls in the
component libs listed in `onnxruntime_INTERNAL_LIBRARIES` (session, optimizer,
providers, framework, graph, util, mlas, common, flatbuffers) plus the external
deps (abseil, onnx, onnx_proto, protobuf, re2, ...). `scripts/package.sh`
collects every archive in the build tree and merges them into one fat library
(`ar -M` MRI script on Linux, `libtool -static` on macOS, MSVC `lib.exe` on
Windows), so consumers only need:

```bash
g++ app.cc -I<pkg>/include <pkg>/lib/libonnxruntime.a -lpthread -ldl -lm -o app
```

Because everything lives in one archive, the linker rescans it until all
symbols resolve — no manual link order is needed. Use `g++` (or add
`-lstdc++`): this is a C++ library even when your own code is C.

The measured `linux-x86_64` result is **7.6 MB** compressed / **35 MB**
uncompressed — versus ~200 MB for a default full build.

#### What goes into the fat archive

`--minimal_build` drops CUDA, contrib ops and ML ops, but **not** the ONNX
protobuf layer, which ORT still needs to read model metadata and opsets. These
are genuine dependencies, verified with `nm --undefined-only` on the component
libs (`onnxruntime_framework` alone references ~251 abseil, 94 onnx and 45
protobuf symbols):

- abseil (~70 archives), onnx, onnx_proto, protobuf-**lite**, re2, cpuinfo
- `onnxruntime_flatbuffers` — the ORT schema wrappers (`onnxruntime::fbs::utils::*`)

Everything else is stripped out:

| Excluded | Why |
| --- | --- |
| gtest / gmock | test framework; also never downloaded (`onnxruntime_BUILD_UNIT_TESTS=OFF`) |
| `onnxruntime_test_utils`, `onnxruntime_unittest_utils` | test helpers |
| `onnx_test_data_proto`, `onnx_test_runner_common` | test data |
| `protoc` | code generator, not needed at runtime |
| `protobuf` (full) | onnxruntime uses protobuf-lite; the full lib only exists for protoc and would force consumers to link `-lz` |
| `flatbuffers` (third party) | Loading an `.ort` model only needs the header-only template types (`flatbuffers::String` / `Vector` / `Offset`). The runtime features of `libflatbuffers.a` — schema Parser, reflection — are never referenced. `flatbuffers::Verifier` is a header-only template, so it is instantiated inline and needs no library. |

Each exclusion was validated by linking with `-Wl,--whole-archive` (which forces
every object to resolve) and diffing the undefined symbols before and after:
**zero new undefined symbols** in every case. The only symbols left unresolved
are three `OrtInteropAPI::ReleaseExternal*` entry points belonging to the plugin
EP interop layer, which are absent upstream as well and never referenced by a
normal link.

## Releasing

`.github/workflows/onnxruntime-release.yml` builds all enabled targets in
parallel and publishes them to a GitHub release.

### Cutting a release

The tag carries the version — push it and the matching release is built and
published:

```bash
onnxruntime/scripts/bump.sh v1.30.0          # see "Upgrading" below
cd onnxruntime && ./build.sh --jobs 4         # verify locally first
git add onnxruntime/ORT_VERSION onnxruntime/onnxruntime
git commit -m "onnxruntime: bump to v1.30.0"
git tag release-v1.30.0
git push origin main --tags
```

`release-v1.30.0` → builds and publishes onnxruntime **v1.30.0** on that tag.

| Trigger | Version source | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| push tag `release-v*` | parsed from the tag name | Build all enabled targets, publish a **public** release |
| push tag `onnxruntime-v*` | parsed from the tag name | same — preferred once the repo vendors more than one dependency |
| `workflow_dispatch` | the `ort_version` input, else `ORT_VERSION` | `draft` (default on) and `dry_run` available |

`ORT_VERSION` remains the local development default. If the tag disagrees with
it the workflow emits a warning so the drift does not go unnoticed.

Runner mapping:

| Target | Runner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `linux-x86_64` | `ubuntu-latest` | ✅ native, verified end to end |
| `linux-aarch64` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | ⏳ native arm64, not yet run |
| `osx-arm64` | `macos-latest` | ⏳ native arm64, not yet run |
| `osx-universal` | `macos-latest` | ⏳ two slices merged with `lipo`, not yet run |
| `windows-x64` | `windows-latest` | ⛔ disabled, see below |
| `windows-arm64` | `windows-latest` | ⛔ disabled, see below |

### Platform status

**Windows is disabled in CI.** The runner image has no Visual Studio instance,
so CMake configure fails:

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (project):
  Generator
    Visual Studio 17 2022
  could not find any instance of Visual Studio.
```

`build.sh` still implements `windows-x64` and `windows-arm64` — only the matrix
rows in the workflow are commented out. To re-enable, uncomment the two
`windows-*` entries in `.github/workflows/onnxruntime-release.yml` (and restore
the Windows rows in the release body table). Packaging additionally needs MSVC's
`lib.exe`, which `scripts/package.sh` locates via `PATH` or `vswhere.exe`.

**Shell compatibility: the scripts target bash 3.2.** macOS ships bash 3.2,
which has no associative arrays (`declare -A`) and no `mapfile`. Everything is
written with plain indexed arrays and `while read` loops, so the same code runs
on the macOS runner, on Linux, and in Git Bash on Windows.

### Testing the workflow before a real release

Do not push a release tag to find out whether the pipeline works. Order:

1. **Syntax / config check, no runner time.** Validate the YAML and confirm the
   matrix resolves as intended:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml;d=yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/onnxruntime-release.yml'));print([m['target'] for m in d['jobs']['build']['strategy']['matrix']['include']])"
   ```

   [`actionlint`](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) goes further and catches
   expression and context mistakes.

2. **Dry run on GitHub, all enabled targets.** Push the branch, then
   Actions → *onnxruntime release* → **Run workflow** with
   `dry_run = true`. Every platform builds and uploads artifacts, nothing is
   published. Download the artifacts and smoke test one of them.

   > The workflow must exist on the **default branch** before `Run workflow`
   > appears in the UI. Push it to `main` first (a dry run publishes nothing).

3. **Optional: run it locally with `act`.**
   [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) executes workflows in Docker.
   It only covers the `ubuntu-*` jobs — macOS and Windows runners cannot be
   emulated — but it is the fastest way to debug the shell steps:

   ```bash
   act workflow_dispatch -W .github/workflows/onnxruntime-release.yml \
       -j build --matrix target:linux-x86_64 \
       --input ort_version=v1.29.0 --input dry_run=true
   ```

4. **Real release.** Only after the dry run is green:

   ```bash
   git tag release-v1.29.0 && git push origin release-v1.29.0
   ```

The `release` job downloads every artifact, generates a download table from the
archives that actually exist (platform, size, SHA-256), writes a combined
`checksums.txt`, and attaches all of it to the GitHub release — so the file list
can never drift out of sync with the build matrix.

If a single target fails, `fail-fast: false` keeps the other five running, and
re-running the workflow after pushing a fix rebuilds everything (there is no
build cache between runs).

### Upgrading onnxruntime

```bash
onnxruntime/scripts/bump.sh v1.30.0
```

That verifies the tag exists upstream, writes it to `onnxruntime/ORT_VERSION`,
checks the submodule out at it (`--depth 1`) and refreshes the recursive deps.
Then verify and commit:

```bash
cd onnxruntime && ./build.sh --jobs 4
git add onnxruntime/ORT_VERSION onnxruntime/onnxruntime
git commit -m "onnxruntime: bump to v1.30.0"
```

Finally push `release-v1.30.0` to build and publish the new version.

Two things worth knowing:

- **`ORT_VERSION` is the local default, the tag is what ships.** On a tag push
  the version is parsed from the tag, so bumping the file alone does not
  trigger anything. Keep them in sync (the workflow warns when they drift) —
  `bump.sh` updates the file, and the tag you push should match it.
- **Recursive deps change between releases.** `bump.sh` re-runs
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`, because upstream regularly moves
  the pinned abseil / protobuf / onnx revisions.

To list available upstream tags:

```bash
git -C onnxruntime/onnxruntime ls-remote --tags origin | grep -oE 'refs/tags/v[0-9.]+$' | sort -V | tail
```

### Notes

- **linux-aarch64 without an arm runner.** `ubuntu-24.04-arm` requires a
  public repository or a paid plan. On `ubuntu-latest` the build script detects
  the mismatched host and falls back to `scripts/cross-linux-aarch64.sh`, which
  installs `crossbuild-essential-arm64` and cross compiles. Change `os` in the
  workflow matrix to switch.
- **Windows generator.** The script deliberately keeps the default Visual
  Studio generator on Windows; ninja is only auto-selected on unix where the
  toolchain is already on `PATH`. Pass `--cmake_generator Ninja` from a
  developer prompt to override.
- **Reproducibility.** `build.sh` re-checks out the pinned tag whenever the
  submodule work tree is clean, so a stale checkout cannot silently end up in a
  release.
